# About the Repository
This repository houses the notebooks I developed during my postdoc at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) during the period October 2020 - October 2022. This are condensed representations of the expirements I tested during the postdoc for how to process, analyze, clean, and extract information from digitized archival materials. Most notebooks rely on leveraging Python machine learning libraries, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, txtAI, Top2Vec, BERTopic, Bulk, Pixplot, and many others.

**WARNING**
As this is data that deals with the Holocaust, some of the material is sensitive in nature (such as graphic images and text). This applies to the texts as well as the images.


# Notebooks
- Clustering Images
- Removing Background from Images


# Textbooks
During the postdoc period, I also developed several open-source textbooks which are available on my website, PythonHumanities.com as subdomains. I developed these so that other scould follow the methodological steps I took during my postdoc and so that others could apply these these methods to their own texts. I designed them for those with limited Python, with key concepts and terms are explained.
